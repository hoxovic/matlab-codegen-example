# Matlab code to C/C++ code generation
This repository serves as a quick introduction to show how Matlab functions can generated to C/C++ code using Matlabs Codegen tool.

# Structure
Place the Matlab code you want to autogenerate in a folder under `matlab_code/<your_project>` similarly to `example_for_readme` 
```bash
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── generate_code.m
├── matlab_code
│   └── example_for_readme
│       ├── Addition.m
│       └── main_addition_test.cpp
└── README.md
```

Then, by running `generate_code.m`, the autogenerated code will appear in a new folder called `./Addition`. Inside `generate_code.m` you have to specify the input/output structure of the function you want to generate.


# Building and running the code with Cmake
Open up a terminal in this folder and run
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
./main_addition_test
```
to run the autogenerated code example.
